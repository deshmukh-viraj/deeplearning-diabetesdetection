# Deeplearning Diabetes Detection
A repository for detecting diabetes using deep learning techniques.

## Short Description
This repository contains a deep learning model for diabetes detection, along with the necessary code and data for training and testing.

## Features
* Deep learning model for diabetes detection
* Training and testing code
* Example dataset (Pima Indians Diabetes dataset)

## Installation
Check repository files for details on installation requirements and procedures.

## Usage
To use this repository, navigate to the `Code` directory and run the `train.py` script to train the model, and the `test.py` script to test the model.

## Example Commands
```bash
python train.py
python test.py
```

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:
* `Code`: contains the model and training/testing code
* `.git`: contains Git version control information

## Dependencies
